# DSCI-100-Group-Project

Group Project Proposal

Introduction:
Our group project will be utilizing the Heart Disease dataset. This dataset tracks various risk factors that individuals with heart disease have, such as their age, sex, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle choices. This data can have a tremendous inmpact on the ability to diagnose heart disease, and identify risk factors in individuals who have not yet presented with heart disease. Our group will be answering the predictive question: Will an individual with middle age and high cholesterol levels have heart disease?
